# Address Validation with PIN Code

This repository contains my solution to the address validation task, which focuses on validating addresses by checking if the PIN code extracted from the address matches the expected format.

## Overview

In this task, we were given the responsibility to validate addresses to ensure that the PIN code corresponds to the address mentioned. The validation was performed using the postalpincode.in API, which provides PIN code information for Indian addresses.

## Code

The Python script for address validation is provided in the file `Q1_Validate.py`. The script includes a `validate_address` function that checks the provided address for a valid PIN code format.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the PIN code validation script:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing `Q1_Validate.py`.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

       python Q1_Validate.py
